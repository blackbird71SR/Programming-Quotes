13. > The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying. __John Carmack__
14. > Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it? __Brian Kernighan__

19. > A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing. __Alan J. Perlis__
20. > Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think! __Steve Jobs__
21. > When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code. __Richard Pattis__
22. > Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. __Ralph Johnson__
23. > Enlightenment is the unprogrammed state. __Jed McKenna__
24. > Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen. __Edward V Berard__
25. > Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out. __Chris Pine__
26. > The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim. __Edsger Dijkstra__
27. > Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. __Filipe Fortes__
28. > when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. ...

33. > Premature optimization is the root of all evil. __Donald Knuth__
34. > Kids who are good at traditional school—repeating rote concepts and facts on a test—can fall apart in a situation where that isn’t enough. Programming rewards the experimental, curious mind. __Ketil Moland Olsen__
